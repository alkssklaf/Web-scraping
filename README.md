**Overview**: During the process of writing this code, I learned how to use Python for web scraping, specifically by employing the requests library to fetch web pages and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content. I gained insights into navigating HTML structures, extracting data from elements like headers, paragraphs, and links, and efficiently using methods such as find, find_all, and select. Implementing regular expressions allowed me to filter text based on specific patterns, enhancing my data extraction capabilities. Additionally, integrating Pandas for directly reading HTML tables improved my ability to handle structured data. This experience has significantly expanded my understanding of web scraping techniques and their practical applications.
